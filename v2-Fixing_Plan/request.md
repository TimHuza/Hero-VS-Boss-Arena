I like your response. But there is some details I have to add to edit this a bit edit. 
1. When I kill an enemy there is going to be +1 score. When the score is going to be 30, the boss will spawn.
2. To defeat boss I will have to survive its 4 attacks. Those 4 attacks are
* Attack 1: Ground Danger - His first attack will come from the bottom. If player collides with it, it’ll kill him. If players’ bullets collide with those squares, they will just disappear and won’t get to the boss. 
* Attack 2: Thunder Nightmare - His second attack. This one just spawns' lines in this position two times for 5 seconds. 
* Attack 3: Gauntlet Death - His third attack is like a DVD player thing. It’ll bounce off the corners and won’t go of the screen and the side where the boss attack’s 
* Attack 4: Dodge Fight - In his last attack you will need to dodge asteroids that fall from top and if you get 20 score than you win the boss. 
3. When the player collides with the boss, it will kill the player. When player survives bosses 4 attacks he will win.
